## Data Quality Checks
- Verify price formatting consistency ($XXX vs XXX)
- Check for duplicate listings
- Validate geographic coordinates within NYC bounds
- Confirm review dates are logical (not future dates)


- **Instant booking availability:** *Do instant bookable properties charge more?*
    - Method: A/B Test: Instant Booking Impact Analysis
    - Groups:
        - Control: instant_bookable = FALSE
        - Treatment: instant_bookable = TRUE
    - **Primary Metric:** Average daily price difference
    - **Secondary Metrics:** Price variance, market positioning
    - **Expected Effect Size:** 5-15% price difference
