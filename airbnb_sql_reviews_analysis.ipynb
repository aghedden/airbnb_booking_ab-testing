    "# Project Aims\n",
    "This project consisted of 2 sub-projects with distinct aims. First, I sought to investigate features of Airbnb listings that are related to pricing and summarize key results through visualizations and a dashboard. **Second, the focus of this notebook, I sought to investigate the features of Airbnb listings that are related to the number and ratings of reviews and summarize key results through visualizations and a second dashboard.** Key methods included:\n",
    "- Pulling relevant data and calculating basic metrics using SQL\n",
    "- Performing A/B tests to determine feature relationships\n",
    "- Using Seaborn and plotly.io to create unique and interactive data visualizations\n",
    "- Creating 2 dashboards of the main findings in Tableau\n",
